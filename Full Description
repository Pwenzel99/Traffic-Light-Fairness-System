In this project, I designed a 4-way intersection management and traffic control system. The
control system will function as follows: there will be four lanes of traffic, each with a capacity limit on
the number of cars at the intersection. The number of cars will be maintained with four specialized
counters. The traffic light system will greenlight one of the four lanes of traffic, which will decrement
the number of cars at the intersection by one for each clock cycle. The traffic will be provided to one
of the four lanes as indicated by the position of four toggle switches. One car will be added to the
specified lane for each clock cycle. If the addition of a new vehicle will exceed the vehicle capacity for
this lane, then the vehicle will not be added. Again, the vehicle count will be maintained by a
specialized counter for each lane.
